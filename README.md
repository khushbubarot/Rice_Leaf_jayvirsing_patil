# Rice Leaf Disease Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting rice leaf diseases using machine-learning techniques. By analyzing images of rice leaves, we aim to build a model that can accurately identify and classify various diseases affecting rice crops.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection:** Gathering a dataset of rice leaf images, labeled with different types of diseases.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Processing images, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve model performance.
- **Feature Extraction:** Using techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract relevant image features.
- **Model Building:** Implementing and evaluating various machine learning models (e.g., CNNs, transfer learning with pre-trained models).
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jayvirsingpatil/rice-leaf-disease-prediction.git
   cd rice-leaf-disease-prediction
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Python installed, and then install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare the Data:**
   Place your dataset of rice leaf images in the appropriate folder and ensure it matches the format expected by the code.

4. **Run the Model:**
   Execute the script to train and test the model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

5. **Evaluate the Model:**
   Review the model's performance using the provided evaluation metrics.

## Usage

You can use the trained model to predict rice leaf diseases from new images. For example, run:
```bash
python predict_disease.py --image_path "path/to/image.jpg"
```

## Results

The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results will be displayed in the output and saved in evaluation reports.
